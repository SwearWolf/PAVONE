Case for george-norton's Peacock Trackpad.

For best printing results print on its side.

Requires 10x M3x6mm screws.

The spacer is for behind the trackpad (bezel>trackpad>spacer>screw) to prevent the kit screws from going out the other side. If you have M3x4mm screws you can skip the spacer entirely.
